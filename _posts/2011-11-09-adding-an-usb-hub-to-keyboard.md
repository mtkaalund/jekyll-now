title : Adding an USB hub to keyboard
layout : post
---
So long time a go, I saw this keyboard with an usb hub build in, I think it was apple that had made it, I really can't remember it. But anyway I wanted a keyboard with an usb hub buildin, not that it would make my life easier but because then I would have one less thing on my table.

I have two usb hub, one with an external power supply and one with out the external power supply, but this one has tree port in front, and one in the back, which suites the purpurs of this mod, just fine.
So the plan is use the one in the back for the keyboard, an the tree others for other usages.

## SAABuino
This project is inspired from [saabman](https://hackaday.io/project/158595-3-blink-modification-for-saab-9-5). At first it had its start from his implementations, but branch "rewrite" has a new implementation, where the "OS" of the arduino switches between the different extras every 200ms (about).
This is a design choice from my side and is made to ease the impementation of new functions. As of writing there has been implemented "FollowMeHome" and "AutoIntervalRearWiper". If you got a SAAB please take a look.
